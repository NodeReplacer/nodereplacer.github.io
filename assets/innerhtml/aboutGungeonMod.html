                        This mod doubles chest drops and raises item drop chance.

                        The enemies have increased health in co-op but this means that
                        it uses more ammo to defeat enemies.
                        <br/>
                        These two players also have to share resources meant for one
                        player between two people.

                        This means that it's likely that the players won't have enough
                        guns or powerups in a game about having wacky guns modified by
                        fun powerups.
                        <br/>
                        Completely running against the central concept of the game.
